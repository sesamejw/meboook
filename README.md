### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Bootstrap 5** with custom CSS for responsive design
- **Lucide React** for modern icons
- **Vite** for fast development and building

### Backend
- **Supabase** for database, authentication, and file storage
- **PostgreSQL** database with Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Supabase Auth** for user management
- **Supabase Storage** for file and image hosting

### Database Schema

#### Books Table
- `id`: Unique identifier (UUID)
- `name`: Book title
- `category`: Book category/genre
- `price`: Book price in USD
- `description`: Book description
- `user_id`: Author/owner ID (foreign key)
- `image_url`: Cover image URL
- `file_url`: Book file URL
- `file_name`: Original filename
- `file_size`: File size in bytes
- `created_at`: Publication timestamp
- `updated_at`: Last modification timestamp

### Security Features

#### Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Public Read**: Anyone can view books in the store
- **Authenticated Write**: Only logged-in users can create books
- **Owner Only**: Users can only edit/delete their own books

#### File Storage Security
- **Separate Buckets**: Images and files stored in different buckets
- **Public Access**: Book covers are publicly accessible
- **Secure Downloads**: Book files are served through secure URLs

## File Upload System

### Supported File Types
- **Images**: JPG, PNG, GIF for book covers
- **Books**: PDF, EPUB, DOCX, TXT, and other document formats

### Storage Structure
```
book-images/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {bookId}-{timestamp}.jpg
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {bookId}-{timestamp}.png

book-files/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {bookId}-{timestamp}.pdf
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {bookId}-{timestamp}.epub
```

### Upload Process
1. Files are uploaded to Supabase Storage buckets
2. Unique filenames prevent conflicts
3. Public URLs are generated for access
4. File metadata is stored in the database

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase account and project

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd bookstore-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Supabase**
   - Create a new Supabase project
   - Set up the database schema using the migration files
   - Create storage buckets: `book-images` and `book-files`
   - Configure bucket policies for public access

4. **Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file with:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Database Setup

Run the migration files in your Supabase SQL editor:
1. `supabase/migrations/20250707182058_dawn_garden.sql` - Initial schema
2. `supabase/migrations/add_file_storage_support.sql` - File storage support

### Storage Bucket Setup

In your Supabase dashboard:
